Hello, my name is Renan Haddad, graduated with a Bachelor's and Masters' in Biological Sciences. 

After going through college and working in both within a Microbiology laboratory and in the field with Behavioural Ecology, 
I began to learn R to facilitate the data visualisation and analysis of my Masters' research. Through that I began to be
fascinated with utilisation of more advanced tools for data analysis, mainly the programming languages. Now, I'm studying
and taking courses to learn more about data analysis, data science, and other related fields to transition my career to this
incredibly interesting field. 

As of right now, I am finishing the 'Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate', hoping to soon apply what I have learned 
in it and in my Masters' degree to real life situations. In the future, I hope to become more experienced and knowledgeable on
this field of Data Analytics and Data Science.
